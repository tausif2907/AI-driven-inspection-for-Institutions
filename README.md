# AI-Driven Inspection for Institutions

## Overview
This AI-powered system enhances institutional inspections by automating evaluations, improving efficiency, and ensuring compliance with institutional standards. The project leverages AI to analyze facility conditions, review documents, collect real-time data, and provide actionable insights.

## Features
- **Automated Facility Inspection**: Uses AI and image recognition to assess infrastructure.
- **Document Analysis**: Implements natural language processing (NLP) for compliance checks.
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Integrates various data sources for up-to-date insights.
- **Machine Learning-Based Predictions**: Identifies trends and anomalies using AI models.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes inspection metrics and trends using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for web-based UI)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data processing)
- **Plotly** (for interactive visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning)

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the Application
Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
streamlit run AI_inspection.py

Dataset
The dataset (institution_inspection_data.csv) includes institutional inspection records with attributes such as infrastructure scores, faculty ratings, student performance scores, and compliance levels.

Usage
> Upload inspection data or use the preloaded dataset.
> Filter by institution type, date range, and compliance level.
> View AI-generated insights through dashboards and charts.
> Use machine learning predictions to assess institutional compliance.
